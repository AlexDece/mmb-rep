+ The (other) files in this folder were created by Kevin Moran.

+ They are a Dynare version of: Meh and Moran. 2010. "The Role of Bank 
	Capital in the Propagation of Shocks", JEDC 34: 555-576
+ the files were written Nov 2010 - March 2011

+ control produces figures for a decline/increase in the interest rate/technology/bank capital 
+ the figures produced differ slightly from the figures displayed in the paper.
	- e.g. the responses of the financial variables to the technology shock 
          are less persistent than in the paper, and the decline in output is less 
	  pronounced. 
	- however qualitatively the results of the paper are preserved. 
	- The case without bank capital is not reproduced.
